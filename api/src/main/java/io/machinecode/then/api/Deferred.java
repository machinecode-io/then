/**
 * <p>A representation of a computation allowing listeners to be notified of state changes. This representation allows
 * for four main states: {@link #PENDING}, {@link #RESOLVED}, {@link #REJECTED} and {@link #CANCELLED}. Of these
 * {@link #RESOLVED}, {@link #REJECTED} and {@link #CANCELLED} will be referred to as 'terminal states', that is a
 * state when the {@link #isDone()} method will return {@code true}. A promise reaches one of these states by a call
 * to a 'terminal method', one of {@link #resolve(Object)}, {@link #reject(Object)} and {@link #cancel(boolean)}
 * respectively.</p>
 *
 * <p>The javadoc here only considers these three terminal states however this definition does not preclude inheritors
 * from adding further terminal states and associated methods.</p>
